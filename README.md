The study of quantum computing is a subfield of quantum information science. There are several types of quantum computers (also known as quantum computing systems), including the quantum circuit model, quantum Turing machine, adiabatic quantum computer, one-way quantum computer, and various quantum cellular automata. A quantum computer is a computer that uses quantum mechanics to store and process information. The basic principle behind quantum computing is that a quantum bit (qubit) can represent a zero and a one at the same time, and that quantum computers can exploit this fact to solve certain problems much faster than classical computers.

The Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation of pure single-qubit states as a point on the unit sphere [1]. Operations on single qubits commonly used in quantum information processing can be represented on the Bloch sphere. 

### postulates of quantum mechanics
The total wavefunction must be antisymmetric with respect to the interchange of all coordinates of one fermion with those of another. Electronic spin must be included in this set of coordinates. The Pauli exclusion principle is a direct result of this antisymmetry principle.

### bra-ket (Dirac notation)
In particle physics, the Dirac equation is a relativistic wave equation derived by British physicist Paul Dirac in 1928. In its free form, or including electromagnetic interactions, it describes all spin-1⁄2 massive particles such as electrons and quarks for which parity is a symmetry...Bra–ket notation you can easily distinguish between scalars, vectors, and operators...is a notation for linear algebra and linear operators on complex vector spaces together with their dual space both in the finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional case. It is specifically designed to ease the types of calculations that frequently come up in quantum mechanics.. It can also be used to denote abstract vectors and linear functionals in mathematics. It is so called because the inner product (or dot product) of two states is denoted by a bracket, <Φ|Ψ>, consisting of a left part, <Φ|, called the bra, and a right part, |Ψ>, called the ket. How do you turn KET into bra? In "matrix language", changing a ket into a bra (or bra into a ket) is a "conjugate transpose": conjugate: 2−3i becomes 2+3i, etc...transpose: rows swap with columns.



### eigenstate
a state of a quantized dynamic system (such as an atom, molecule, or crystal) in which one of the variables defining the state (such as energy or angular momentum) has a determinate fixed value.

### The Hamiltonian of a system 
specifies its total energy—i.e., the sum of its kinetic energy (that of motion) and its potential energy (that of position)

### difference between Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics 
is that Lagrangian mechanics describe the difference between kinetic and potential energies, whereas Hamiltonian mechanics describe the sum of kinetic and potential energies.
