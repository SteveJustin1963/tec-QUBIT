TEC-1 Quantum computer

A quantum computer is a computer that uses quantum mechanics to store and process information. The basic principle behind quantum computing is that a quantum bit (qubit) can represent a zero and a one at the same time, and that quantum computers can exploit this fact to solve certain problems much faster than classical computers.

### Trapped ion 
quantum computer is one proposed approach to a large-scale quantum computer. Ions, or charged atomic particles, can be confined and suspended in free space using electromagnetic fields. Qubits are stored in stable electronic states of each ion, and quantum information can be transferred through the collective quantized motion of the ions in a shared trap (interacting through the Coulomb force).

### Diamond-based 
quantum computing is a promising approach to quantum computing that uses the properties of diamonds to create qubits. Diamonds have a number of properties that make them ideal for quantum computing, including their long coherence times, which allow them to remain in a quantum state for a long time. Additionally, diamonds can be easily manipulated and controlled, making them well-suited for use in quantum computers. Synthetic diamonds have high thermal conductivity and is an electrical insulator. It has a type of impurity called an N-V center, in which a nitrogen atom takes the place of one carbon atom in the diamond, and a vacancy takes the place of a neighboring carbon. An unpaired electron circulates around the nitrogen-vacancy center. This electron can be excited or polarized by a laser.  When excited, the electron emits a single photon as it falls back to a lower energy state. The electron can be put into a quantum superposition where it has both spin up and spin down, so it could potentially be used as a qubit, a quantum bit that is both 0 and 1 at the same time that would form the basis of a quantum computer.


### Quantum dots 
(QDs) are man-made nanoscale crystals that that can transport electrons. When UV light hits these semiconducting nanoparticles, they can emit light of various colors. These artificial semiconductor nanoparticles that have found applications in composites, solar cells and fluorescent biological labels.

### A Rydberg atom 
is an excited atom with one or more electrons that have a very high principal quantum number, n. The higher the value of n, the farther the electron is from the nucleus, on average.
