TEC-1 Quantum computer

The study of quantum computing is a subfield of quantum information science. There are several types of quantum computers (also known as quantum computing systems), including the quantum circuit model, quantum Turing machine, adiabatic quantum computer, one-way quantum computer, and various quantum cellular automata. A quantum computer is a computer that uses quantum mechanics to store and process information. The basic principle behind quantum computing is that a quantum bit (qubit) can represent a zero and a one at the same time, and that quantum computers can exploit this fact to solve certain problems much faster than classical computers.

The Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation of pure single-qubit states as a point on the unit sphere [1]. Operations on single qubits commonly used in quantum information processing can be represented on the Bloch sphere.

- https://github.com/Spooky-Manufacturing

### how do you program in it?
- https://try.q-ctrl.com/blackopal-app/



### Iterate
- combine qbit, pbit and/or [https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-RANDOM] with [https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-STOCH] , and Feigenbaum constants into a new hybrid
